## <em>Description</em>

## <em>Environment settings</em>
you have to install python requirements, just execute this command:
```
pip install openai moviepy requests dotenv pillow numpy
```
the reason why i didnt made requirements.txt to provide installation automatically is it can be changed a lot after.
